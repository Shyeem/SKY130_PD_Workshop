Working directory is 
~/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
ss4
There are multiple files in the direcotry
The designs are in design folder

There are 30-40 designs
We will be doing picorv32a
ss3
>Src→ verilog + sdc
>Config.tcl → bypasses any configurations done to the lane
	Adds the settings specific to the design
	Time period is set [this overwrites the default openlane settings]
How the openlane takes the values
>Default values in open lane
>config.tcl
>Then sku130A_sky130….tcl
  This is the highest priority one and this will be considered for the design

<ss2>
%docker
%./flow.tcl -interactive
When we do an interactive we do a step by step process
Without interactive it will run the complete flow without showing
<ss1>

%prep -design picorv32a
ss5
Import all the packages required to run the flow

##the above 3 steps have to be done everytime
